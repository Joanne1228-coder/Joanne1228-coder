💻 I’m a fourth-year Software Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Malaya based in Kuala Lumpur, keen to explore and understand how real-world systems and technologies are maintained, enhanced, and evolved.

🏆 My goal for this course is to gain the insights of modern maintenance practices and obtain hands-on experience in levelling up software performance and ensuring the sustainability of the system.

🚀 I look forward to collaborating with peers on open-source projects, learning clean code principles, and implementing practical approaches to handle real-world software challenges.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy playing around with UI features, solving user pain points and discovering backend development tools which enable software to be more stable, accountable and maintainable!
